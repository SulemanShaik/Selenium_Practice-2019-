Xpath:
======
 * Xpath is defined as xml path
 * it is a syntax or language for finding any element on the web page using
    XML path expression.
   
 * Xpath is used to find the location of any element on a webpage
      using HTML DOM Structure.
 

There are 2 types of xpath:
--------------------------

1.Absolute Xpath
2.Relative Xpath


Absolute Xpath: It uses Complete path from the Root Element to the desire element.
Relative Xpath: You can simply start by referencing the element you want and gofrom there.
 Relative Xpaths are always preferred as they are not the 
 complete paths from the root element.
 
The primary difference between XPath and CSS Selectors is that,
with the XPath we can traverse both forward and backward whereas CSS selector
only moves forward. Although CSS selectors perform far better than Xpath and it is
well documented in Selenium community. It has following advantages over XPath as:

Xpath engines are different in each browser, hence make them inconsistent

  IE does not have a native xpath engine, therefore selenium injects its own xpath
  engine for compatibility of its API. Thus losing the advantage of using native
  browser features.

  Xpath tend to become complex and hence make hard to read.

  However there are some situations where, you need to use xpath, like while searching
  for a parent element or searching element by its text.

                           Custom CSS

                                
1.idhtmltag#id , #id
2.class htmltag.classname, .classname, .c1.c2.c3, html.c1.c2.c3…cn
3.parent>childtag

4.htmltag[id='test']

input[id='txtUsername']         CSS   with one attribute
//input[@id=' txtUsername']    xpath
